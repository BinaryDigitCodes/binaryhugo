Hi I'm B. By day I'm a tech director for a digital media company and in my free time I like to game, mix music, take photos, tinker with code and travel when I can. 

I try to write frequently on my micro blog and longer stories on my Wordpress blog. I am getting back into streaming games and my music DJ mixes. You can see me live on Twitch or watch offline videos on either Makertube (part of the fediverse) or YouTube!
