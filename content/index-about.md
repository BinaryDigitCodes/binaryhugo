Hi I'm "B". By day I'm a tech director for a digital media company and in my free time I like to game, mix music, take photos, tinker with code and travel when I can. 

I'm currently in the process of re-discoverying my creativity and seeing where it can take me next in my career. I try to write about what I'm up to on [Mastodon](https://mstdn.games/@BinaryDigit) or my [blog](https://blog.binarydigit.io). 

I'm doing a digital overhaul for the next few months. Visit my links above if you're interested in my [projects](/projects/)!
