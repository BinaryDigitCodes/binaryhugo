## Website redesign

I'm redoing my website with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and loving it so far. A while back my brain didn't click well with static site generators, but now I'm loving it.

I'm using the [Gokarna](https://gokarna-hugo.netlify.app/) theme which is simple yet super customizable.

## Music Site

[BinaryDigit.rocks](https://binarydigit.rocks) A place to upload my mixes with song lists as a back up to SoundCloud and YouTube/PeerTube. I'll probably move it to this domain eventually but since I still have Wordpress hosting I am using a nice media wrapper plugin and WP theme.
