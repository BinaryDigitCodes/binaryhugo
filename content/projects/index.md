## This Website Redesign

I'm redoing my website with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and loving it so far. A while back my brain didn't click well with static site generators, but now I'm loving it.

I'm using the [Gokarna](https://gokarna-hugo.netlify.app/) theme which is simple yet super customizable.

## Digital Cafe/Garden

I'll be keeping my cute .cafe domain and thought why not try to make a personal wiki, or as some people call it, a digital garden. Mine will be a "cafe" of course.

## Livestream

I stream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/binarydigit/about) with a fallback to [YouTube](https://youtube.com/BinaryDigit). I'm working on getting a schedule back on track with a mix of playing games one day, then DJ sets the next.
