This is a [now](https://nownownow.com/about) and what I'm focused on at this point in my life.


I love to be creative in my personal time (code, art, photography), support open source, and love all things technical, so right now everything intersects well. 

## Feeling

A lovely human named [Keenan](https://mstdn.games/@keenan) on Mastodon posted the question "What is currently giving meaning to your life?‚Äù 

I responded as quickly as I could with no hesitation: ‚ÄúRediscovering things that bring me joy, such a photography, music, light coding/making things pretty. I need more beauty in my life so I want to create it‚Äù.
