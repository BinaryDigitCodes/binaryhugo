      <description>I probably won&amp;rsquo;t end up using the blog portion of Hugo since I already have a blog, but I call it &amp;ldquo;site updates&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Hi I&amp;rsquo;m &amp;ldquo;B&amp;rdquo;. By day I&amp;rsquo;m a tech director for a digital media company and in my free time I like to game, mix music, take photos, tinker with code and travel when I can.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently in the process of re-discoverying my creativity and seeing where it can take me next in my career. I try to write about what I&amp;rsquo;m up to on Mastodon or my blog.
I&amp;rsquo;m doing a digital overhaul for the next few months.</description>

      <description>Website redesign I&amp;rsquo;m redoing my website with Hugo and loving it so far. A while back my brain didn&amp;rsquo;t click well with static site generators, but now I&amp;rsquo;m loving it.
I&amp;rsquo;m using the Gokarna theme which is simple yet super customizable.
Music Site BinaryDigit.rocks A place to upload my mixes with song lists as a back up to SoundCloud and YouTube/PeerTube. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably move it to this domain eventually but since I still have Wordpress hosting I am using a nice media wrapper plugin and WP theme.</description>

      <description>Video I haven&amp;rsquo;t uploaded in a while, but here are my current uploads to PeerTube, which is a fediverse video upload site similar to YouTube. You can watch my playlist there as well!
Audio I also upload my music to SoundCloud if you want to listen to some mixes I&amp;rsquo;ve streamed online. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a seperate website for uploading, but might just merge the efforts into my one website here.</description>
