      <description>I probably won&amp;rsquo;t end up using the blog portion of Hugo since I already have a micro blog and longer blog, but I might post when I make any manjor changes as a change log of sorts.</description>

      <description>Hi I&amp;rsquo;m B. By day I&amp;rsquo;m a tech director for a digital media company and in my free time I like to game, mix music, take photos, tinker with code and travel when I can.
I try to write frequently on my micro blog and longer stories on the &amp;ldquo;cafe&amp;rdquo;, my Wordpress blog. I am getting back into streaming games and my music DJ mixes. You can see me live on Twitch or watch offline videos on either Makertube (part of the fediverse) or YouTube!</description>

      <description>A /now page is a great way to share whatâ€™s going on in your life now. I love to be creative in my personal time (code, art, photography), support open source, and love all things technical, so right now everything intersects well.
Doing Rediscovering things that bring me joy, such a photography, music, light coding/making things pretty. I need more beauty in my life so I want to create it.
